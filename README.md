## pyTetris_OOP
It is an app for OOP based on many creations avavaible in GIT and other internet souruces. App is rather dull but i have made all i can in my free time. First commit after some offline testing, on 21.05, maybe i will do some better job later.

Also, shout out to benycze and his project: https://github.com/benycze/python-tetris - it is in Python 3 and from first look it would be far better to inspire on that project (as i did in some logic problems).


## What do you need to run it
Project is in Python 2.7.#. and needs pygame. You can install it by:

`pip install pygame`

or

`conda install -c cogsci pygame`

depending if you use Anaconda or not.
More about pygame here: https://anaconda.org/cogsci/pygame and here https://www.pygame.org/news.
  
### Feel free to crush it with dust :)
No licence - use it, copy it, blame it as you wish :)

### In future, maybe i will suceed to move it to Python 3.#.
